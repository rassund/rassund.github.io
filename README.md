## About Me
Hello! I am an IT student at the Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. I am passionate about all things programming and software development, and in this portfolio you will find various software projects I have either made myself or have helped contribute to as part of a team.

## School Projects
These are projects that I have made for various courses in school. Many of them were made in collaboration with other students.

### Pong game for microcontroller
This was a project I made for a course in computer hardware engineering. It is a recreation of the classic Pong game for a microcontroller, and it is developed almost entirely in the C programming language.

These are projects that I have made in my free time, either for fun or to further hone my skills.

Nothing to show right now.
