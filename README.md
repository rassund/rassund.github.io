# Portfolio

## About Me
Hello! I am an IT student at the Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. I am passionate about all things programming and software development, and in this portfolio you will find various software projects I have either made myself or have helped contribute to as part of a team.

## Projects

### DroneZone
DroneZone is a web application for synchronizing and monitoring active, flying drones in Sweden. With this application, you can easily fly your drone without interrupting other airborne objects. This project was made in collaboration with six other students, utilizing the agile development framework scrum to organize the team and our work. I was mainly responsible for implementing the front-end logic using React, bridging the front-end and the back-end, and helping with designing our database.

### Pong game for microcontroller
This was a project I made for a course in computer hardware engineering. It is a recreation of the classic Pong game for a microcontroller, and it is developed almost entirely in the C programming language.
